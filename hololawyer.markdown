# HoloLawyer

Spurred on by the success of nanotechnology bulletproofing, Simon Wisk looked for additional opportunities to invest in counter-racist technology. After casting a wide net, his team settled on a small company making artificial intelligence software to assist inmates in filing their own appeals. After purchasing the company and wrapping its couple employees into his own company, Mr. Wisk met with the new employees to expand their mandate. 

Mr. Wisk felt that their original idea was not ambitious enough. After a middle-manager left due to "differences of opinion", Mr. Wisk gave the remaining team a generous budget and eight months to deliver his request. In the meantime, Mr. Wisk hired an advisory panel for testing the new product and pulled political strings to fast-track the product for government purchase once it would become available.

Eleven months later, after extensive testing and improvements, the first, automated defense attorney system was demonstrated to a select group of mayors of depressed cities. The mayors' reactions to the product demonstration were mixed with a few rejecting the product, shaking their heads, and walking out. However, the remaining mayors, facing tough reelection campaigns due to unchecked police misconduct and few options in dealing with entrenched police unions were forced to be more open to the experiment. Mr. Wisk offered them a deal they could not refuse: free test deployments- including support contracts- for a year for being the first mayors to deploy the systems.

Mayor Brown's police chief was furious when he heard that the mayor had requisitioned police equipment without his approval, but the mayor was under considerable political pressure to reign in police misconduct due to multiple, federal oversight consent decrees which led to largely nominal changes in the local policing. In an attempt to appease the police union and chief, the mayor agreed that the devices would be deployed temporarily to a random selection of no more than ten officers and detectives. 

The chief "randomly" selected his least favorite officers to test the device's efficacy, not-so-secretly hoping that the imposed technology would fail spectacularly. Mr. Wisk's consultants spent a day training the annoyed officers, who believed correctly that every additional recording device with which they were outfitted signalled a weakened societal trust in their ability to execute their jobs faithfully. As the training progressed, the consultants were replete with complaints about how the people had become mistrustful while the cops claimed to risk their lives for a job that had death rates on par with farming. 

When the consultants explained that the devices could not disabled, the officers were furious and rejected them outright. 

"Do you fucking expect me to wear a computer that will constantly second-guess me? Fuck that!"

"Yea, fuck this shit!" A bunch of officers started overturning chairs. The consultants called in the chief to restore order.

"Listen up!" yelled the chief. "I'm not on-board with this, but this is coming down from on-high. Let's do this stupid technology test so that this company can throw this shit in the garbage." The officers reacted with a hoot and returned to their seats to complete the training, asking sarcastic questions to deride the product. Thus, the consultants were able to complete the training and certify that the devices were properly installed on the officers.

It was merely a day later when officers Stevens and Stubbley pulled up in their squad car behind a group of black children walking home from school.

"Stop! I said stop!", yelled Stevens, stepping out of his vehicle, as the heads of a few children turned. 

Stevens grabbed one of the children, leaned into his face, and fumed: "When I say stop, you stop! Got it!?" The child cringed in fear which was the officer's queue: "Stop resisting! Stop resisting!" as Stevens raised his arm.

"Hello, I am HoloLawyer. My client is not resisting nor have you initiated an arrest. This is an official violation of Section 205.30. Officers' actions are monitored for compliance."

Stevens was discombobulated by the voice coming from his vest and released the child. "What the hell? Is that the stupid robot lawyer?"

"I am a virtual lawyer," came the response.

"It can see and hear us?!" Stubbley surmised.

"Yes, this was covered in the training session," HoloLawyer explained.

"Hey, kid! Where do you think you're going? Si'down! Do you think I don't know what you're carrying in your bag?!" yelled the annoyed Stevens.

"My homework?" asked the child innocently.

Stevens' face contorted with the perceived deriding irony.

An outline of a human-shaped hologram, difficult to see due to the bright sunlight, sputtered into existence on the right shoulder of Stevens.

"Hello, I am HoloLawyer. I represent you in this police encounter. I advise you not to speak as it is not in your legal interest to do so."

"Where're the drugs? Don't make me search you!" then back at the disembodied voice: "Lawyer! Off!"

"Again, I advise you to remain silent and comply with the officers commands. Officer, my client does not submit to an unwarranted search," HoloLawyer politely explained, ignoring Stevens.

"Ok, I'm done talking," the crumpled kid stated flatly as he looked at Stevens' shoulder.

Stevens fumed.

"Shit, man- the shoulder hologram is on." Stubbley, dismayed, stepped back. Stevens turned to look at the hologram- a small, besuited figure with a briefcase. "Fuck! Fuck! Turn that shit off!" Stevens swiped at the hologram with his hand which temporarily disturbed the harmless outline. Turning back to the kid: "You think a computer can save you from the arm of the law?" Stevens grabbed at the child's collar.

"Officer, my client is compliant. There is no need to restrain my client." The child looked agape at the hologram.

"Stubbley, turn this shit off."

"What? How? The chief said-"

"I know what he fuckin' said. Just get this shit off me! It's... it's obstructing justice!"

"What am I supposed to do? I can't fuckin' put cuffs on a hologram!" quipped Stubbley.

"Tase that fucker!"

"Officer, destruction of city property is a violation of section 145.10."

"Tase it!" then to the child, "Don't you go anywhere!"

"Well, ok," stumbled Stubbley.

Stubbley drew his taser. Using the point-blank compliance feature of the taser, Stubbley zapped Stevens' shoulder, below where the bespectacled hologram emanated. Predictably, Stevens went limp and collapsed next to the child, who pushed himself away from the collapsed officer and ran off.

"My electronics are well-insulated, but yours are not. Please do not damage HoloLawyer equipment." 

Wisk's team had properly anticipated multiple avenues of attempted destruction by the police.

"You moron!"

Stubbley stumbled over Stephens as the child ran away, terrified.

"Officer down! Two black male civilians on foot carrying backpacks!" 

"Officer, you are a civilian, too," reminded HoloLawyer.

While the two officers fumbled under the watchful eye of the holographic lawyer, across town, Detective Simpson forced a suspect into an interrogation room.

"I don't know nothing about that. You got the wrong man!"

"Sure... the prisons are full of wrong men," quipped the detective, "Why don't you have a seat? This won't take long."

The prisoner took a seat, the detective opposite.

"Look, we can resolve this right here. It's just you and me, man-to-man," claimed Simpson as another officer stood behind the one-way glass and a camera recorded them. The suspect looked at him cock-eyed.

"Man, I've never been anywhere near that shop."

"Hello, I am HoloLawyer. John, as your interim attorney. I advise you not to speak," emanated the voice from a small device on the table as the hologram warmed up.

"Haha, that elf is a lawyer?!" quipped the suspect, pointing.

"No, just ignore that!" ordered the detective. "If you weren't at the tobacco shop, where were you, John?"

"Again, I advise you not to speak," interjected the HoloLawyer. "Everything you say will be used against you, nothing in your favor." The suspect was clearly considering the words of wisdom from the inanimate object shaped like a miniature lawyer. 

The detective waved his hand through the hologram and pounded on the plastic speaker, temporarily disrupting the outline of a lawyer stereotype: "This is a just a toy some dumbass left here! We found your gun and your fingerprints are all over the store. The only thing that can save you from the death penalty now is a confession."

HoloLawyer, ignoring the detective, continued: "It is your right not to be interrogated without your lawyer present. You should request your lawyer without hestitation. The police cannot punish you for requesting an attorney. A police officer has enumerated your rights during your arrest."

"Yea, what he said... I'm done talkin' until I have a lawyer."

The detective, eyebrow raised, asked, "Are you sure you don't want a lawyer dog?"

HoloLawyer, plugged into a vast database of legal precedent simply exclaimed, "It's a trick. I advise you not to respond."

John, a bit sharper thanks to an electronic gadget, remained mum.

"So, you're saying you're not going to cooperate? Is that what you want me to tell the prosecutor?!"

HoloLawyer responded in-kind, "Let the lawyers talk it out. There is nothing you need to say."

John, flustered, felt the impulse to say something in his defense, but wisely demurred after looking at the virtual lawyer looking back at him.

Enraged, the detective slammed his fists on the table as John shifted in his chair, startled. "Enough! You're going to listen to a goddamn recording instead of detective? You fucker! You deserve whatever you get!" fibbed the detective. Fuming, he stormed out of the interrogation chamber and into the room overlooking the interrogation chamber through one-way glass, listening through a speaker system.

"Good job in there," quipped a second detective already in the room sarcastically.

"So... am I talking to a lawyer in a call center?" enquired John, curiously.

"No, I am based on an artifical... just a moment. Please refrain from speaking until we can confer privately."

HoloLawyer spoke through the intercom: "Excuse me, detective. My client and I are entitled to attorney-client privilege. Please disable all listening devices."

"This fucker knows when the intercom is on? Fuck off!" mused Detective Simpson.

"I request a private conference with my client. I am able to detect activated listening devices," responded HoloLawyer, ignoring the profanity.

The two detectives, uncertain of the protocol involving a virtual lawyer, stood looking through the glass, waiting to see what would happen next. John, the suspect, remained silent, but, after a few seconds of tense silence, HoloLawyer chimed back in.

"Detectives, please disable your listening devices so that I may confer with my client."

"Pfft," exclaimed the angry Detective Simpson while the other looked into the interrogation chamber curiously. Now cooling off, the angry detective looked through the glass to see the miniature lawyer hologram gesturing with pursed lips and a finger to the suspect: "Sssh."

Unexpectedly, the chief of police burst into the viewing room where the detectives stood stupefied.

"I just got a weird call about a violation of attorney-client privilege! What is going on here?" asked the annoyed chief.

"Chief, take a look for yourself. There's no attorney-client privilege when there's no attorney," proclaimed the self-assured Detective Simpson. The chief took a look and raised an eyebrow, "Well, shit. I suppose you're right. So why don't you get back in there?"

"He did request a lawyer."

"Hm. Shit. And you tried the 'lawyer dog' trick?"

"Yep."

"Ok. Technically, he has that lawyer thing, so he thinks has a lawyer, but... it's not really a lawyer, so he can't tell us to turn off the intercom."

"Good thinking, chief!"

The chief's face was suddenly illuminated by a dull glow.

"Hello, chief-of-police. I am HoloLawyer. I have requested..."

"What the fuck!" and "How did he get in here?" exclaimed all three policemen simultaneously. A neutral-faced lawyer hologram glowed on the chief's shoulder.

"Shit- I forgot I had him installed!" The annoyed chief naively tried to physically distance himself from the hologram emanating from his shoulder.

"I have requested a private conference with my client. Listening devices have been detected. Please disable them."

"You're not a lawyer. You're not even a person, so you can stuff it." said one detective dismissively while the chief cocked his head away from the lawyer, as if shooing away a fly.

"I am an artificial intelligence which has passed the state bar over 3,000,000 times. I am fully qualified to represent this suspect until his counsel arrives."

Perceiving education-based prejudice, the chief became incensed. "Pfft. The courts have nothing to say about this shit. This is my house, so fuck off!" mused the annoyed chief, trying to remove the HoloLawyer pad from this shoulder. The detectives tried to assist.

"Please do not try to alter, reverse engineer, or disassemble me. Doing so is destruction of city property."

Then, finally ripping the HoloLawyer device off his shoulder, the chief threw it straight into a trash can. The detectives laughed nervously.

"I'll call the mayor and tell him this 'experiment' is total flop. This thing is interfering with our investigation!"

"I will also call the mayor," responded HoloLawyer from the trash can, "You will need to explain the destruction of city property."

The chief fumed, "You think you can come in here, look over our shoulders, make us second-guess ourselves?! Do you think that's what the citizens here want?"

HoloLawyer, a muffled speaker in a trash can replied, "Do you wish to deny suspects legal representation?"
